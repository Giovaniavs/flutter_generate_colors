# Flutter Generate Colors
## ðŸ“– Main objectives:
- [X] Create a screen that changes the backgrund color every time the user taps on it;
- [X] Create the generate color and random number functions without libraries;
- [X] Use the base template with the default actions and linters.
  
## ðŸ“– Secondary objectives:
- [X] Created two unitary tests to make sure that the main objectives are working properly;
- [X] Added smooth animation to the changing color behavior;
- [X] Created an organized README.md to improve the documentation.

# Features descriptions

Generate random colors algorithm: The idea here was, firstly, generate random numbers from 0 to 255 into a list and, after that, shuffle the List and take the very first element (actually I could take any element from the list, because it was entirely shuffled, however to make it clear and simpler I preferred taking the first element). Now, with the random number I filled them into the fromRgb() method of Colors class to generate the desired random colors.

OBS 1: I was having a specific problem with the action "Dart Code Metrics" and it looks like a problem with generated projects from the template, I found this Issue documented in the template's repository [here](https://github.com/solid-software/flutter_project_template/issues/12). So, in order not to be blocked by this issue, I skipped and let the other actions run.

OBS 2: I was in doubt about using the method nextInt from dart:math because it is a library, native from dart but still a library. Then to make sure, I developed a standalone function to generate these random numbers from the List logic described above.
